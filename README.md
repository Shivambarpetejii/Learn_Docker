QUESTION NUMBER 31 :- Explain Docker Swarm and its key components.

    Docker Swarm is Docker’s native container orchestration tool that lets you manage a cluster of Docker engines as a single virtual system. It enables scaling, high availability, and service discovery — like a simpler version of Kubernetes.

    🧩 Key Components of Docker Swarm
        1. Swarm Cluster:-
            A group of Docker nodes (machines) working together as one system.
                You initiate a swarm using:docker swarm init
        2. Nodes
            A node is a Docker Engine instance participating in the swarm.

| Node Type   | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manager** | Manages the swarm state, schedules tasks, handles orchestration.  |
| **Worker**  | Executes containers (tasks), receives instructions from managers. |


        3. Services
            A service is a definition of how you want to run your app across the swarm (like a blueprint).
            EXAMPLE :- docker service create --replicas 3 nginx

        4. Tasks
            A task is a single running container managed by Swarm. Tasks are the atomic unit in a service.

        5. Load Balancing
            Swarm automatically load-balances requests across service replicas using an internal DNS system.        

        6. Overlay Network
            Swarm nodes can communicate across hosts using a virtual network.

        7. Service Discovery
            Each service has an internal DNS name, so containers can find each other by name — no need for hardcoded IPs.

        8. Rolling Updates
            Swarm supports zero-downtime deployments using rolling updates:

    ⚡ Quick Command Recap
    
docker swarm init                    # Initialize swarm (on manager)
docker node ls                       # View nodes
docker service create --replicas 3 nginx  # Deploy service
docker service update                # Update a service
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack  # Deploy with stack


===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 32:---How would you secure a Docker container and Docker daemon?

    Securing Docker involves two key areas:

            🔐 Securing Docker Containers

            🛡️ Securing the Docker Daemon (Engine)

🔐 1. Securing Docker Containers:- 
    ✅ a. Use Minimal Base Images:-
        * Use slim images like alpine, debian:bullseye-slim, etc.
        * Reduces attack surface. 
        Dockerfile Addd :- FROM node:18-alpine
    ✅ b. Run as Non-Root User
        * Avoid running apps as root inside the container.
        Dockerfile add :- RUN adduser -D appuser
                            USER appuser
    ✅ c. Use Read-Only File System
        CMD:- docker run --read-only my-app
    ✅ d. Limit Container Capabilities\
        CMD :- docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE my-app
    ✅ e. Use Seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux
    ✅ f. Scan Images for Vulnerabilities

    🛡️ 2. Securing Docker Daemon

    ✅ a. Use TLS to Encrypt Docker API
        If remote access to the Docker API is enabled (-H tcp://...), use TLS:
    ✅ b. Disable Docker Socket Exposure
        Avoid running containers with access to Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) — it gives full root access to the host.
    ✅ c. Restrict Access to Docker Group
        The docker group is equivalent to root. Limit who’s in this group.
    ✅ d. Use User Namespaces
        This remaps container users to less privileged host users:
===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 33:-What are Docker secrets and how do they work?

    Docker Secrets let you securely store and manage sensitive data (like passwords, API keys, SSL certificates) and make them available to containers at runtime — without baking them into images or exposing them in environment variables.

    📌 Docker Secrets are only available in Docker Swarm mode.

🧩 Why Use Docker Secrets?
        🔒 Encrypted at rest and in transit

        🚫 Not exposed in docker inspect or ps

        ✅ Accessible only by containers that need them

📦 Types of Data You Can Store
            Database passwords

            TLS/SSL private keys

            API keys or tokens

            SSH keys
        
🛠️ How Docker Secrets Work (Step-by-Step)

    ✅ 1. Initialize Docker Swarm:> docker swarm init
    ✅ 2. Create a Secret:> echo "my-password" | docker secret create db_password -
    ✅ 3. Use the Secret in a Service
        docker service create \
            --name myapp \
            --secret db_password \
            myapp-image
    ✅ 4. Accessing Secrets Inside Container

    🚫 Limitations:---
            | Limitation                      | Notes                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Not for standalone containers | Only available in Swarm mode                    |
| ❌ Not editable                  | You can't update a secret; you must recreate it |
| ❌ Not available as env var      | Available as files, not environment variables   |


===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 33:-  Explain the concept of Docker content trust.

Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a security feature that uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of Docker images.
    With DCT enabled, only signed images can be pulled or run, ensuring the image is from a trusted source and hasn’t been tampered with.

    🧩 Key Concepts
    | Term               | Meaning                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signing**        | Verifying the identity of the image publisher                 |
| **Publisher**      | The person/team that creates and signs the image              |
| **Notary**         | The tool used by Docker for managing image signatures         |
| **Trust metadata** | Stored separately from the image to track its signed versions |

Enable it for a single command:DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 docker pull ubuntu:latest

    🛠️ How DCT Works (Simplified Flow)
        1. Image is Signed

            When pushing an image, Docker uses Notary to sign it.

            Private keys are used to generate the signature.

        2.  Image is Pulled

            When DCT is enabled, Docker checks for a valid signature before pulling.

            If the image is unsigned or the signature doesn't match, the pull fails.

    🚫 Limitations:-
        | Limitation                                         | Detail                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🛑 Not all images are signed                       | Most public images are not signed yet    |
| 🧪 Requires Notary setup to sign                   | Signing images manually needs Notary CLI |
| 🗃️ Only works with Docker Hub and some registries | No support for all registries            |


✅ Benefits of Docker Content Trust
        🔒 Ensures images come from verified publishers

        🧪 Prevents tampered/malicious image pulls

        🧬 Adds another layer of CI/CD pipeline security



===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 34:-  How would you implement CI/CD pipeline with Docker?


Implementing a CI/CD pipeline with Docker helps automate building, testing, and deploying containerized applications in a consistent and scalable way.

✅ 1. Build Stage
    Dockerize your app with a Dockerfile.

        # Example Node.js Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]

Use CI tool to build the Docker image:docker build -t myapp:latest .

✅ 2. Test Stage
    Run unit/integration tests inside a Docker container.   
        docker run --rm myapp npm test
        You can also use a separate test container in Docker Compose or CI YAML.

✅ 3. Push to Docker Registry
    After tests pass, tag and push the image to Docker Hub or any private registry:
✅ 4. Deploy Stage
        Use docker-compose, docker service, or orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) to deploy the container.

🧪 Example: GitHub Actions CI/CD with Docker:📁 .github/workflows/docker.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Docker
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t myapp:latest .

    - name: Run Tests
      run: docker run --rm myapp npm test

    - name: Log in to Docker Hub
      run: echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} --password-stdin

    - name: Push image
      run: |
        docker tag myapp:latest mydockerhubuser/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push mydockerhubuser/myapp:${{ github.sha }}

    - name: Deploy to production (example)
      run: ssh user@your-server "docker pull mydockerhubuser/myapp:${{ github.sha }} && docker restart my-container"

===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 35:-  What are namespace and cgroups in the context of Docker?


In Docker (and containers in general), namespaces and cgroups are key Linux kernel features that provide isolation and resource control. Together, they make containers feel like lightweight, isolated virtual machines.

🧱 1. Namespaces — Isolation Mechanism

    Each container gets its own set of namespaces so that:

        It can’t see other containers or host processes.

        It has its own network stack, mount points, etc.

🔑 Types of Namespaces Used by Docker:
| Namespace Type | What It Isolates                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `pid`          | Process IDs (each container has its own PID tree) |
| `net`          | Network interfaces (e.g., own IP, ports)          |
| `mnt`          | Mounted filesystems                               |
| `uts`          | Hostname and domain name                          |
| `ipc`          | Inter-process communication (e.g., shared memory) |
| `user`         | User and group ID mappings                        |


⚙️ 2. Cgroups (Control Groups) — Resource Control Mechanism
    Cgroups limit and monitor how much a container can use.

        They control:

                    🧠 Memory usage

                    🖥️ CPU share and quota

                    💾 Disk I/O

                    🌐 Network bandwidth (with plugins)
===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 36:-  How does Docker implement isolation at the kernel level?

Docker implements process and resource isolation at the Linux kernel level using two main features:


===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 37:- What is the overlay network driver and when would you use it?

The overlay network driver in Docker is used to connect containers running on multiple Docker hosts (i.e., machines) into a single virtual network. It enables multi-host communication and is essential for Docker Swarm or distributed applications.

🧱 How It Works:-
Docker uses VXLAN (a Layer 2 over Layer 3 tunneling protocol) to encapsulate container traffic.

Each container gets a virtual interface that appears to be on the same subnet — even if they're on different machines.

Docker takes care of routing the packets over the physical network using encrypted tunnels.

✅ Use Cases for Overlay Networks

| Use Case                              | Why Overlay is Useful                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧵 Docker Swarm mode                  | Enables communication between services on different nodes |
| 🌍 Multi-host container deployments   | Connect containers across VMs or cloud instances          |
| 🔐 Secure communication               | Supports **encrypted** service-to-service traffic         |
| ⚙️ Service discovery + load balancing | Built-in DNS-based service discovery in Swarm             |


===================================================================================================QUESTION NUMBER 38:-Explain Docker image layer optimization techniques.

Optimizing Docker image layers helps you create smaller, faster, and more efficient images — which improves build times, deployment speed, and reduces storage/bandwidth usage.

🚀 What Are Docker Image Layers?
        Each command in a Dockerfile (like RUN, COPY, ADD) creates a new layer. Docker caches these layers and reuses them when possible.

🎯 Why Optimize Docker Image Layers?
        ⚡ Faster builds via layer caching

        📦 Smaller image size → faster downloads & deployments

        🔐 Fewer vulnerabilities from unused packages
